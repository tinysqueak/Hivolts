# Hivolts

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to reimplement the Hivolts game.

### Description

The specification of this project was to reimplement the Hivolts game with updated, modern graphics. We have successfully reproduced the game to play like the original as according to the specifications on paleyontology.com. We have designed new and updated graphics to meet the criterion.
